  title: Open Science Framework Create a contributor
  description: |-
    Adds a contributor to a node, effectively creating a relationship between the node and a user.

    Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.

    Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic" contributors. From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.
    #### Permissions
    Only project administrators can add contributors to a node.
    #### Required
    A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.

    All attributes describing the relationship between the node and the user are optional.
    #### Returns
    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.

    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        ###Waterbutler API actions

        Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`).

        #### Download (files)

        To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.

        #### Create Subfolder (folders)

        You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

        #### Upload New File (folders)


          To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.


        #### Update Existing File (file)

        To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to "file". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file.

        #### Rename (files, folders)

        To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to "rename" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.

        #### Move & Copy (files, folders)

        Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.
        Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.
        If a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.

        #### Delete (file, folders)

        To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body.

      description: |-
        Creates a new node.

        On the OSF, nodes are considered **projects** or **components**. The difference between a project and a component is that a project is a top-level node, and a component is a child of a project.

        Additionally, nodes have a `category` field that includes **project** as an option. The categorization determines what icon is displayed with the node on the OSF, and helps with search organization. Projects (top-level nodes) may have a category other than project, and components (children) may have a category of **project**.
        #### Required
        Required fields for creating a node include:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`title`

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`category`

        Note: Nodes default to **private** unless the `public` field is explicitly set to **true** in the request payload.

  /nodes/{node_id}/comments/:
    get:
      summary: List all comments
      description: |-
        A paginated list of comments related to a given node.

        The returned comments are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent comments appearing first.
        ####Permissions
        Comments on public nodes are given read-only access to everyone.

        If the node comment-level is `private`, only contributors have permission to comment.

        If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.

        Comments on private nodes are only visible to contributors and administrators on the parent node.
        ####Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of comment objects. Each resource in the array is a separate comment object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include comments that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/comments/?filter[target_id]=jg7sezmdnt93

        Nodes may be filtered by their `deleted`, `target_id`, `date_created`, `date_modified`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail.

      description: |-
        Create a comment on a given node overview page or a reply to a comment on that node.

        To create a comment on the node overview page, the target `type` would be "nodes" and the target `id` would be the node `id`.

        To reply to a comment on this node, the target `type` would be "comments" and the target `id` would be the `id` of the comment to reply to.
        ####Required
        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the target (`comments` or `nodes`) type and a target `id` is required.
        In addition, the `content` attribute describing the relationship between the node and the comment is required.
        ####Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a data key containing the representation of the new comment, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

  /nodes/{node_id}/contributors/:
    get:
      summary: List all contributors
      description: |-
        A paginated list of the node's contributors, sorted by their index.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor, meaning additional requests to a contributor's detail view are not necessary. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9jdt/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.

        Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.

        Adds a contributor to a node, effectively creating a relationship between the node and a user.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic" contributors. From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators can add contributors to a node.
        #### Required
        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.

        All attributes describing the relationship between the node and the user are optional.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
