        ###Waterbutler API actions

        Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`).

        #### Download (files)

        To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.

        #### Create Subfolder (folders)

        You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

        #### Upload New File (folders)


          To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.


        #### Update Existing File (file)

        To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to "file". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file.

        #### Rename (files, folders)

        To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to "rename" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.

        #### Move & Copy (files, folders)

        Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.
        Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.
        If a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.

        #### Delete (file, folders)

        To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body.

      description: |-
        Creates a new node.

        On the OSF, nodes are considered **projects** or **components**. The difference between a project and a component is that a project is a top-level node, and a component is a child of a project.

        Additionally, nodes have a `category` field that includes **project** as an option. The categorization determines what icon is displayed with the node on the OSF, and helps with search organization. Projects (top-level nodes) may have a category other than project, and components (children) may have a category of **project**.
        #### Required
        Required fields for creating a node include:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`title`

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`category`

        Note: Nodes default to **private** unless the `public` field is explicitly set to **true** in the request payload.

  /nodes/{node_id}/comments/:

      summary: List all comments
      description: |-
        A paginated list of comments related to a given node.

        The returned comments are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent comments appearing first.
        ####Permissions
        Comments on public nodes are given read-only access to everyone.

        If the node comment-level is `private`, only contributors have permission to comment.

        If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.

        Comments on private nodes are only visible to contributors and administrators on the parent node.
        ####Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of comment objects. Each resource in the array is a separate comment object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include comments that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/comments/?filter[target_id]=jg7sezmdnt93

        Nodes may be filtered by their `deleted`, `target_id`, `date_created`, `date_modified`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail.

        To reply to a comment on this node, the target `type` would be "comments" and the target `id` would be the `id` of the comment to reply to.
        ####Required
        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the target (`comments` or `nodes`) type and a target `id` is required.
        In addition, the `content` attribute describing the relationship between the node and the comment is required.
        ####Returns

      summary: List all contributors
      description: |-
        A paginated list of the node's contributors, sorted by their index.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor, meaning additional requests to a contributor's detail view are not necessary. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9jdt/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.

        You can optionally request that the response only include files that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/files/osfstorage/?filter[kind]=file

        Node files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `node`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`.

        ###Waterbutler API actions

        Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`).

        #### Download (files)

        To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.

        #### Create Subfolder (folders)

        You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

        #### Upload New File (folders)

        To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

        #### Update Existing File (file)

        To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to "file". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file.

        #### Rename (files, folders)

        To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to "rename" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.

        #### Move & Copy (files, folders)

        Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.
        Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.
        If a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.

        #### Delete (file, folders)

        To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body.

        A paginated list of the current node's forks. The returned fork nodes are sorted by their `forked_date`, with the most recently forked nodes appearing first.

        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing node and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 forked nodes. If the current node has zero forked nodes, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the forked node, meaning additional requests to the forked node's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        Creates a fork of the given node.

        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing node and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.

        You might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.

        When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current node and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.
        #### Required
        There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked node's attributes will be copied from the current node.

        The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current node's title.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete srepresentation of the forked node, if the request is successful.
        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        #### Acceptable Subjects Structure
        Each preprint provider specifies acceptable subjects.
        `subjects_acceptable` is an array found in `attributes`.
        Subjects consist of general parent subjects (e.g., Engineering), more specific child subjects (e.g., Aerospace Engineering), and even more specific grandchild subjects (e.g., Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics). Subjects can only be nested 3 deep.

  /registrations/:
    get:
      summary: List all registrations
      description: |-
        A paginated list of registrations on the OSF to which the user has access.

        The returned registrations are those which are public or which the user has access to view.

        Non-registered nodes cannot be accessed through this endpoint (use the [nodes](#Nodes_nodes_list) endpoints instead).

        #### Registrations
        A registration on the OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted. The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.

        Registrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.

        #### Withdrawals
        Registrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata. A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors. All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        This request should never return an error.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter[title]=open.

        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.

        #### Permissions
        Only project contributors may retrieve the details of a registration that is embargoed, or has not yet been made public. Attempting to retrieve a private registration for which you are not a contributor will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.

        Authentication is not required to view the details of a public registration, as public registrations give read-only access to everyone.

        The list will include child registrations that are public, as well as child registrations that are private, if the authenticated user has permission to view them.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 child registrations. If the given registration has zero child registrations, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the child registration.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/children/?filter[title]=reproducibility.

        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public is a boolean field, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.

        A paginated list of all contributors on this registration.
        The returned contributors are sorted by their index.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the registration or, in the case of private registration, have read access to the registration.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed in the contributors list on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        A paginated list of storage providers enabled on the registration

        Users of the OSF may access their data on a [number of cloud-storage services](https://api.osf.io/v2/#storage-providers) that have integrations with the OSF. We call these **providers**. By default, every node has access to the OSF-provided storage but may use as many of the supported providers as desired.


        ####Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        Note: In the OSF filesystem model, providers are treated as folders, but with special properties that distinguish them from regular folders. Every provider folder is considered a root folder, and may not be deleted through the regular file API.

      summary: Create a fork
      description: |-
        Creates a fork of the given registration.

        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing registration and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original registration, forming a network of registrations.

        You might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.

        When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current registration and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.
        #### Required
        There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked registration's attributes will be copied from the current registration.

        The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current registration's title.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete representation of the forked registration, if the request is successful.
        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
